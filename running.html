		<h2>Where I go to meditate and let go.</h2>
		<p id="p1">
			On an ambitious day I may decide to run through Santee side of trails up into Tierrasanta that bends along Clairmont Mesa Blvd. Or, on some hot summer days, I decide to hike a peak or two and enjoy every moment of taking things a bit slower. Though most think exercise is for physical health, these mountains have helped shaped who I am today. Challenges with wildlife like rattlesnakes, day to day stress, or having the gates close at 7pm during the summer time, running and hiking these trails has helped me enjoy wildlife more and the beautiful views helps me to enjoy life more.<br><br>

		<h3>5 Peak Challenge</h3>
		<p>
			I found out about the 5 Peak Challenge at Mission Trails aorund January 2016 and I enjoyed learning so many people were coming from around the world to recieve their certificate of completiion. Though I have hiked all of these peaks many times, I hardly hike with my phone, so I still need to bring my phone with me and take a selfie at the top of each peak to receive my own certificte of completion!
